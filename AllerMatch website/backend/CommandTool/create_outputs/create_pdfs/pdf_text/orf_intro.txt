The input sequence has been translated to a protein sequence using the translation table: '%s, more info at 'https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Taxonomy/Utils/wprintgc.cgi'. An open reading frame (ORF) has been defined as a stretch of amino acids between %s with a minimum length of %s. This has been done for all six possible reading frames(three in the forward direction and three in the reverse). Dupplicate ORFs have been removed.ENTERThis ORF search identified %s ORFs as shown in the table below.
