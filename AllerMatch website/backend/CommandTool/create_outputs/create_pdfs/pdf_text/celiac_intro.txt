The epitope database is constructed by the combination of three different sources. Epitopes from Sollid and coauthors (https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31735991/), ProPepper (https://www.propepper.net/epitope) and AllergenOnline (http://www.allergenonline.org/celiacbrowse.shtml) were combined and duplicates were removed.

For homology search Allermatch uses FASTA(v36.3.8h) with default the parameters(matrix = BLOSUM50(15:-5), open = -10, extend = -2, ktup = 2)

Each of the ORF sequences has been compared with the epitope database using three different in-sillico similarity search methods:
    - A partial epitope match, where each epitope from the epitope database is compared to each ORF and 
      the top hits are retained. All the hits are sorted on E-value and the top 100 with the lowest 
      E-value are shown.
      ENTER
    - An identical epitope match, where each epitope from the epitope database is compared to each ORF
      and only 100% hits are retained.
      ENTER
    - A Q/E-X1-P-X2 motif search, where each of the possible 50 motif combinations is matched to each
      ORF. Additional a motif occurence is calculated, which indicates how many times a certain motif
      is present in the epitope database.
